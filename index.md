## Favorite 120L Labs

*Lab 4

  The reason I liked Lab 4 is that, as someone who just started learning computer programming, I felt proud of creating code that others could use. I realized that converting units was simpler than I thought, yet somewhat confusing at the same time. I also felt that this lab would serve as a stepping stone to perform better in future labs.

*Lab 6, part 1

  Lab 6 was a project I personally enjoyed more because the teamwork with my partner went really well. Being able to input information the way I wanted, have the program save it, and then output it felt like something I’d actually experience when using an app. It made me realize that I’m really learning programming. The fact that the theme was about choosing ingredients for making a sandwich also made it fun.

*Lab 9

  Lastly, Lab 9 was fascinating in both Part 1 and Part 2, as it involved coding tasks like finding a secret number and creating a word search. I remember struggling quite a bit due to small mistakes and the many tests I had to pass, but eventually solving everything gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment among all the labs.
